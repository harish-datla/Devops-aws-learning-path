## Welcome to the AWS Learning Path :cloud:
An open collaboration by `maronavenue` and `rhobinjay` (and many more to come) for consolidated learning resources and materials to obtain AWS Associate-level certifications and/or simply dive right into AWS and Cloud computing. :smirk:

### Preamble
The consolidated contents are comprised of both free and paid services that were fully consumed by the collaborators. In this way, we ensure that we provide an accurate description of our various takes on the materials in respect to our common goals. Custom-made materials and notes from everyone that will help setup a particular service/scenario, or simplify a concept are cordially accepted. They should be locally linked from the main page to dedicated subfolders. For example, test dataset with commands to generate and populate a DynamoDB table. We shall label it as `Native`:house: and also recognize the contributor who made all the efforts.
